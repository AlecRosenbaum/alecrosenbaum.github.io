I started this without a totally clear picture of what it was going to look
like when done, but I think it turned out pretty well.

Made with a long piece of maple, a scrap piece of walnut (for the top and
frame), and some particle board for the bottom and dividers.

It turned out that I didn't make the box exactly square, which made the whole
process a lot more time consuming when trying to get the top pieces and base to
line up flush.

* Started with a maple board, cut into pieces for the sides
* Put a basic dado into them for the dividers
* Cut rabbets on the end for a rabbet joint around all the edges
* Glued together, poorly. I should have used a square clamped to the inside to
  make sure the box turned out square. The sawdust was to make glue cleanup
  easier.

At that point, I designed and started making the frame. The idea was to have
it reuse the dados from the dividers. These turned out not to be the exact
same width, so the frame only fits in one way.

The amount of space was also very limited, as I wanted it to be able to fit
inside of the closed box.

The design was largely inspired (re: stolen) from some of the better selling
frames on amazon. The dowels are cut in half length-wise, then clamped using
wing nuts on each corner. This works _well enough_, but the walnut used here is
way too hard to clamp properly given the clearance it has on each end. I may
redo this frame with a slightly different design in the future to make it more
ergonomic.

After that, came the top and handle. I had a single board of walnut with a
usable pice that was _just_ wide enough to use for the top. It wasn't quite
wide enough to cover the whole thing, which is why there's maple sides on the
top. These also give the top just enough clearance to store the frame when it's
folded flat.

The leftover piece of walnut had a huge void that I'd been cutting around, but
the outsides had enough clearance for the bits of the handle. I ended up using
as much length as I could, which came out to just enough length that when I
glued them together I could attach them to the box with a bit of space left
over.
