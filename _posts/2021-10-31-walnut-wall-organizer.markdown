_Finished_

I've been looking for small projects to use wood from the scrap bin, and this
one had been requested for a while. I picked out some pieces, then cut them to
rough dimension. I resawed one 2" thick piece of walnut into two 1" pieces I could
use for the back and bottom, and picked out a piece of aluminum rod from the
scrap metal bin. I think it came from a slide-out dvd organizer?

Well then I just assembled it with some screws, and it was pretty much done!
