Started like most projects, with some rough wood I got for almost free. It was
quite hard to get enough usable boards out of it because of how warped
everything was.

From there I made some dodgey plans

Getting the side together, then dry fitting all the base:

Looks good enough, on to the top. I added a bowtie to the end of one board that
had a pretty big split in it. This should prevent it from splitting further.
