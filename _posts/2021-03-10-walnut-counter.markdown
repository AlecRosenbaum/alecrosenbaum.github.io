_Finished_

Phew. It looks so simple, but it was a lot of work. I made this counter top as
a wedding gift for one of my closest friends.

So let's start. First off, mostly of this wood started as scrap off-cuts. I
bought a dust collector from a local guy who was moving, and he had a bunch of
this wood laying around. I figured I could use it (and I did), so I brought it
back with me.


:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Nearly all of these pieces weren't flat, and none of them were over 1" thick.
Unfortunately, the counter I planned was 1.5" thick. RIP. So rip I did, into
many 1"x1.5" thick strips (slightly oversized of course). I now have a bunch of
new, smaller scrap as well. What a hoot.

Since these all started as disperate scrap pieces, none of them were the same
thickness. I'll skip over the planer fun here, but it was just great feeding
in strip after strip until they were all a uniform shape.

With that done, it was time to glue. I chose to split the glueup into two
glueups of a half each, then a final glueup of both halves. This way I could
make each half thin enough to fit into my thickness planer and end up with nice
uniform surfaces.

With the halves glued up, it was time to put my plan into motion. My jointer
isn't quite this wide, so I started with a hand plane on the bottom side to
work out any major defects. Things like glue squeezeout and any major pieces
that stuck out.

From there they were flat enough on one side to run through the thickness
planer. I did both the top and a few cleanup passes on the bottom of each half.

With both halves flat, next was a few iterations of scraping (with a card
scraper) and gap filling. The wood had small imperfections in it, and some of
the glueups were less than perfect. Glue + card scraper shavings worked really
well and matched exactly.

This was the first major project where I used a card scraper to do most of the
heavy lifting, and I've got to say it was fantastic. For larger projects with
flat panels I will certainly be using it again.

Below are pictures of the halves aftering being rubbed down with mineral
spirits.

Up next: the big glue up. It was time to glue both halves together to form the
actual counter.

At this point the counter is actually pretty big -- big enough that I can't
neatly fit it on any of my go-to tools. It took a little setup, but I was able
to use a framing square to guide a circluar saw and cut the counter to final
length. It took a few tries to get it set up such that I wouldn't bump the
saw's motor into any of the clamps.

Then just one last round of scraping and gap filling, then it's pretty much
finished! Since this counter will likely be used for food prep, I opted for a
food safe finish. I applied a few rounds of food-grade mineral oil, then a few
more rounds of howard's butcher block conditioner (which contains wax as well).

Here's the result before installation:

I also ordered some powder black aluminum legs, but they didn't arrive in time
for our visit. So the morning of, I whipped up some makeshift legs out of
2x4's. These will be replaced 1 for 1 with the final legs when they arrive in
the mail (shipped directly to them).
