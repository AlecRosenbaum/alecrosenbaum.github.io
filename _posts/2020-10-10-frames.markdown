_Finished_

Doing some decoration in my office, I had these smaller, square paintings just
on particle board and no frame. Some of the other paintings I have were framed
with a thick, black edge. I had some poplar around big enough to span the full
edge, so I made some matching frames. This isn't particularly complicated, but
making miters sized correctly that also look pretty can be a bit fiddly.

The first step was cutting all the edges to size.

Then I used painters tape and a square to do the glue up. The painters tape did
a very good job of keeping all the edges flush and applying good clamping
force.

With the glue done and the frames square, next step was paiting. I just used
some scrap cutoffs to stand them off my table, then spray painted them with
black primer/paint spray paint (3 light coats).

I didn't snag a picture, but once the paint dried I carefuly glued the
paintings to the frames (with just some wood glue). The paintings are acrylic,
so I really needed to be careful with any pressure on them. I used some paper
and just weighted it down with my cordless drills and some heavy-ish tools
so it was flat against the frame.

And that's it! Finished:
