I'm a Rick and Morty fan, so naturally when I [heard they were bringing back szechaun sauce][cripsytenders], I was pretty excited! Though, finding where the closest participating location was seemed a little bit clunky. Selecting my state, then scrolling through a list of regions wasn't super helpful. So, I harvested the data backing the list, and plotted each location on a map.

Enjoy!
