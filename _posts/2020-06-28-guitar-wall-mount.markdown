No WIP pictures, unfortunately. Made with a board of curly maple.

* Started with a rough maple board
* Spent way too much time trying to get it flat faces on my old jointer
* Chamfered the edges with a 45 deg router bit
* Created the small stand-offs with a 45 deg cuts on the table saw.
* Stole the U-hooks from older and uglier mounts, they're held in with T-nuts
* Finished it with spraypaint clear laquer
