_Finished_

We wanted a bench for our entryway and looked on craigslist. A pew came up in
our search, so we bought it!

The seller surprised us with "you'll have to unbolt it from the floor and also
cut it to get it out of here", but such is craigslist. Unfortunately he only
had a hand saw, and I didn't think to bring a circular saw :(

The rough saw marks didn't exactly look great, so we took the pockets off of
the back and salvaged some wood with a matching finish. It covers the sawn
edge, and provides a litle bit of support for the floating bench.

And moved inside:

Not too bad for an evening of work!
