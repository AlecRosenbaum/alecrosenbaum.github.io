_Finished_

My mom just bought a house out-of-state, and found herself with quite a few
things she wanted to clear out of storage. Among them was this awesome brass
sculpture my dad did when he was in college. Over the years, the pine base has
started to give way, and on carpet doesn't quite have large enough of a
footprint to be stable (and stand up in the face of curious animals).

So I set out to make a new base.

_Before, and the rough sketch I based my design on._

The above picture also shows the pretty big piece of maple I had left over from
building a desk earlier this year. My goal was to make the base entirely out
of the one maple block. I also had a few leftover black angle brackets from
shelving I recently put up, so I could use those to frame the base and
further highlight the contrast.

			With a few tricky cuts, everything came out of the one block with
			the grain running in directions I thought would look nice and give
			good surface area for glue-ups not on end-grain.
		</p>

		<p>
			It doesn't look as drastic in the photo, but I'm somehow always
			surprised how much of a difference sanding makes. With just a few
			quick passes on the belt sander, it looked like an entirely
			different piece of wood.

		<p>
			Next up, a dry fit of all the pieces and figuring out where to put
			the hole in the base. The brass sculpture has a threaded rod
			sticking out of the bottom, which is how it attached to the old
			base. For the new base I just took the old base, centered it on the
			new block, then drilled a hole in the same spot. That way, all the
			relative offsets were kept from the original mount.

This is now coming together pretty nicely. All that's left is some extra
sanding to knock down sharp edges, and then a few coats of polyurethane.

And that's it! Finished:
