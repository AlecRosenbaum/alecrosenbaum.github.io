In 2021 a nearby bowling alley was being demolished and they gave away sections
of old bolwing lanes. They were maple, so I took a few without any projects
in mind. Fast foward to 2023 and they've been in my garage for a while and
are quite a pain to move around, so I asked some friends if they wanted
anything made from it. They wanted a kitchen island, so off to the races I
went.

_Alley loaded on a trailed behind my then car, a GTI clearly fit for hauling.
Then then what each section looked like when I started_

I got a base on etsy made of square tubing, delivered to my house. It was just
raw metal. But it looked really good so I just put a coat of clear laquer on it
to prevent rust.

Part of why I haven't used these lanes is because the material is very dfficult
to work with. The strips of maple are _stapled_ together, with enormous 2 inch
long staples. Then there's a 2x4 stapled + glued to the bottom. So taking them
apart and reusing wasn't really doable, and the 2x4 holds a very specific curve
along the top (so that when you bowl it nudges the ball towards the gutters).

To get something usable for a flat surface, I ripped off the 2x4. The top then
still held together, but would flex significantly and was not structurally
sound. This meant I could take some _actually_ straight boards and re-join them
to the top to make it both flat and structurally stable.

Even after this, the top was still in very rough shape though. It came from a
demolition construction site, so there were many deep grooves in the top's
surface. Initially I thought about sanding it all down, but I'd probably have
to remove about an 1/8 of an inch from the entire top, while keeping everything
completely level / even. That did not seem doable.

Instead, since the top was already flat, I used a handheld router with a sled
and spiral bit to remove big sections down the length of the table. The columns
left over kept a surface I could ride the router sled on, then once done I could
swap the sled to ride the carved out sections and route the elevated sections
instead. Afterwards I much less sanding to smooth it all out. I only did this
for the top, since the shelf would mostly be hidden anyway.

The top now mostly resurfaced, I could see what I was working with and decide
where to remove extra to bring it down to dimension. I don't have a track saw,
so I extended the bottom of my circular saw out past the motor. Now I can
use a weighted-down factory edge of 8 foot plywood as a guide. Even if I had a
track saw I'm not sure I'd use it on this material. The staples are _really_
hard and by the end of this project I had chipped off quite a few of the
carbide teeth on my circular saw blade. After cutting to width I chamfered the
structural 2x6's underneath so they wouldn't easily be visible from above.

And of course cutting it to width left a bunch of staples on the edges to be
pulled. I used vice grips to create a sort of head of the cut off ends, then
a pry bar to get them out. Then I could put some wood filler in the holes and
there at least woudn't be shiny metal bits poking out.

After a few rounds of finish sanding -> filler in staple holes I could be
finished with the top.

And that was just half! Then I had to repeat everything for the shelf.

First, rough cut to length.

![](/static/posts/maple_kitchen_island/70_cut_shelf_to_length.jpg) | ![](/static/posts/maple_kitchen_island/71_rough_shelf_surface.jpg)

Then flatten / readd structure with 2x6's.

Then measure / cut / fit to the interior width of the base.

Once fit to width I went back and finish sanded, and added some breadboard ends
similar to what I did on the top. On the top I attached them with screws with
oversized holes to allow for wood movement. Then I squared off the countersink
and cut a perfectly-fit rectangular piece to seal it in. On the base I left the
screw heads visible.

With it done I still had to attach it to the base, which meant drilling some
big screw holes through the 1/8 inch thick, 2x2 steel tubing (with a hand
drill!). Then marking the holes on the underside of the shelf, putting in some
machine screw inserts, then screwing everything in.

All that, and it _should_ be done? But it turns out it's too heavy for me to
flip over alone in my shop. I actually had to get a mini manual forklift to
be able to load it into my car. It just barely fit in the back of my Toyota
Highlander.

At my friends house, it took a few people to unload and maneuver into position.
Then I finally saw it finished right side up!

I like how it turned out, and I'm really glad it didn't get damaged in transit!
