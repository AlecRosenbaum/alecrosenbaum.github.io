_Finished_

We adopted a puppy a few months ago, and it turns out that he's a handful to
watch just one one floor, let alone when he has free reign to go up and
downstairs as he pleases. The first iteration of this gate was pretty ugly
(pictured below), as it was an "oh shit I need a Temporaryâ„¢ gate done today"
type project. 3 months later, we were still using it with no sign of getting
rid of it, so here we are. A slightly better version (with a hinge!).

_Before_

First things first, some designs. I knew I had some "reclaimed" (re: from
old furniture from next to a dumpster) plywood and oak, which would hopefully
match the oak railings already in place. The dimensions for the pieces were
largely based on what I had on-hand + the space between the banisters.

Next, a whole lot of rabbets and dados. Each piece of the outer frame is joined
with a rabbet, and each vertical piece is dado'd in.

Up next, glue.

Finally, what turned out to be longest part of this process: painting. I knew
leaving the unpainted column dados was going to be a little bit of a pain, but
I definitely underestimated how much of a pain. Not pictured here is the
half-can of black spray paint I wasted before coming to the conclusion that the
whole thing needs a dedicated layer of primer for a consistent finish. The
plywood was too porous for the primer already baked into the spray paint, and
little bits of the previous finish were still on the surface in some places
(making it unevenly glossy/flat).

_Painting the frame black_

Once the black frame was done, I could peel off the tape masking off the
columns, and instead mask off the frame. Not wanting to mask off the whole
thing, I opted to use brush-on polyurethane instead of the stuff from a spray
can. It's much easier to not get finish everywhere when it's brushed on.

_Painting is done_

To attach this to the existing bannister (without drilling into it), I attached
that long piece of oak to the bannister using hose clamps. These get really
tight, so I didn't have to make any complicated clamping mechanism. I did make
a few little "L" pieces so the metal didn't dig into the corners, but beyond
that this setup works pretty well. The hinges attach to the long piece of oak
and to the plywood on the frame. I also scavenged a spring and screwed it in
so that the gate gently pulls itself closed.
